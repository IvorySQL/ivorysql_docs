== Enhancements & Fixed Issue

- PostgreSQL 17.0 Enhancements

1. New memory management system for VACUUM, which reduces memory consumption and can improve overall vacuuming performance.
2. New SQL/JSON capabilities, including constructors, identity functions, and the JSON_TABLE() function, which converts JSON data into a table representation.
3. Various query performance improvements, including for sequential reads using streaming I/O, write throughput under high concurrency, and searches over multiple values in a btree index. 
4. Logical replication enhancements.
5. New client-side connection option, sslnegotiation=direct, that performs a direct TLS handshake to avoid a round-trip negotiation.
6. pg_basebackup now supports incremental backup.
7. COPY adds a new option, ON_ERROR ignore, that allows a copy operation to continue in the event of an error.

- IvorySQL 4.0

1. Oracle invisible columns compatibility: https://github.com/IvorySQL/IvorySQL/issues/608[#608]
Add support for invisible columns and describe invisible columns in psql extended describe (\d+) in oracle mode only. Any general access to a table will not display invisible columns. Invisible columns must be explicitly referenced by their column name for queries and other operations to access them.

2. Oracle package compatibility: https://github.com/IvorySQL/IvorySQL/issues/589[#589]
Support PL/SQL package management, including creating, altering, and describing packages and package bodies. The PostgreSQL interactive terminal (psql) has been enhanced with a new \k command for package-related operations. Additionally, advanced privilege management is enabled through new ACL functions, and package caching has been implemented to boost performance.

3. Function pg_get_functiondef support multiple OIDs and function names: #696
Enhance function pg_get_functiondef() to support multiple function OIDs in parameter list. It also can export function definition with same name but different parameters now. 

4. Add 'ivorysql' as default database: #575

5. Provide Ubuntu installation package: #703
