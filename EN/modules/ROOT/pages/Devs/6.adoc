# **Installation Deployment**

## Installation overview

This article introduces the installation process and precautions of Ivorysql on Linux platform. This article mainly demonstrates the yum source installation steps, rpm package installation steps, and source code installation steps of the database under the Centos 7 environment.


=== Software and hardware requirements

==== Introduction to software resources
|====
| operating system | Yum source download address
| CentOS 7、CentOS 8 | https://yum.highgo.ca/ivorysql.html
|====

==== Hardware resource preparation

|====
| Configuration parameters | **Minimum configuration** | **Recommended configuration**
| **CPU** | 4 cores | 16 cores
| **Memory** | 4GB | 64GB
| **Storage** | 800MB，mechanical hard disk | Above 5GB，SSD or NvMe
| **Network** | gigabit lan | 10 Gigabit network
|====

=== Environment and configuration check

Before deploying the IvorySQL database, you need to check the system environment and configuration

==== View resources

The IvorySQL database supports CentOS 7. X, 8. X operating systems. For details, refer to <<#_software_and_hardware_requirements>>.

==== View the operating system

Run the following command to view the operating system information：

```
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

==== View kernel parameters

```
uname -r 
```

==== View memory and clear cache

```
free -g

echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```

=== Get installation package

You can install the IvorySql database or RPM package through the source code.

==== Use source code to build IvorySQL database

1.Get the source code: Run the following command to clone the source code of the IvorySQL database to your build machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/IvorySQL/IvorySQL.git
```

> Note: To clone code, you need to install and configure Git first. For details, refer to https://git-scm.com/doc[Git doc].

2.Install dependent packages: To compile IvorySQL from source code, you must ensure that prerequisite packages are available on the system. Execute the following command to install related packages：

```
sudo yum install -y bison-devel readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel wget
sudo yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'
```

> Note: "Development Tools" includes gcc, make, flex, bison.

3.Self-compilation and installation: The source code obtained previously is in the folder IvorySQL. Next, we will enter this folder for operation.

Configuration: Root users execute the following commands to configure:

```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ivorysql/ivorysql-1.2
```

> Note: Because -- prefix is not provided, it is installed in/usr/local/pgsql by default, so you need to specify the path

> Note: We should remember the specified directory, because the system cannot find out where the compiled and installed programs are. More configure parameters can be viewed through "./configure -- help". You can also view the PostgreSQL manual

Compile and install: After the configuration is completed, execute make to compile:

```
make
```

Perform a regression test before installing the newly compiled service (the following commands can be used):

```
make check
make check-world
```

Installation:

```
make install
```

==== Install the IvorySql database using the RPM package

1. Run the following command to download the IvorySQL installation package.

```
wget  https://yum.highgo.ca/dists/ivorysql-rpms/1/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/ivorysql1-1.2-1.rhel7.x86_64.rpm

wget  https://yum.highgo.ca/dists/ivorysql-rpms/1/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/ivorysql1-contrib-1.2-1.rhel7.x86_64.rpm

wget  https://yum.highgo.ca/dists/ivorysql-rpms/1/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/ivorysql1-libs-1.2-1.rhel7.x86_64.rpm

wget  https://yum.highgo.ca/dists/ivorysql-rpms/1/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/ivorysql1-server-1.2-1.rhel7.x86_64.rpm
```

> Note: The installation package in the example may not be the latest version. It is recommended that you download the latest installation package.

2.Run the following command to install IvorySQL.

```
yum install -y libicu libxslt python3                   --Install dependencies first
rpm -ivh ivorysql1-libs-1.2-1.rhel7.x86_64.rpm
rpm -ivh ivorysql1-1.2-1.rhel7.x86_64.rpm
rpm -ivh ivorysql1-contrib-1.2-1.rhel7.x86_64.rpm --nodeps
rpm -ivh ivorysql1-server-1.2-1.rhel7.x86_64.rpm
```



### 1.1.4 Initialize database service

#### Initialize database

1.Create an operating system user: under the user root session, create a new user ivorysql:

```
/usr/sbin/groupadd ivorysql
/usr/sbin/useradd -g ivorysql ivorysql -c "IvorySQL1.2 Server"
passwd ivorysql
```

2.Create a data directory and modify permissions: Execute the following command in the root session:

```
mkdir -p /ivorysql/1.2/data
chown -R ivorysql.ivorysql /ivorysql/1.2/
```

> Note: The data directory is not placed in "/var/lib/ivorysql/ivorysql-1/data" according to RPM installation.

3.Environment variable: switch to user ivorysql, modify the file "/home/ivorysql/. bash_profile", and configure the environment variable：

```
umask 022
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
export PGDATA=/ivorysql/1.2/data
```

Make the environment variable effective in the current ivorysql user session:

```
source .bash_profile
```

You can also log in again or open a new user ivorysql session.

4.Set the firewall: If the firewall is enabled, port 5333 needs to be opened:

```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5333/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

> Note: The default port is 5333. If the port is not opened, the external client will fail to connect via IP.

5.Initialization: Under user ivorysql, simply execute initdb to complete initialization:

```
initdb
```

> Note: The initdb operation is the same as PostgreSQL. It can be initialized according to the habits of PG.

6.Start database: use pg_ Ctl starts the database service:

```
pg_ctl start
```

View the status and start successfully:

```
pg_ctl status
```

=== Configure service

1.Client authentication: modify/ivorysql/1.2/data/pg_ Hba.conf, add the following:

```
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               trust
```

> Note: This is trust, which means that you can log in without password.

Execute the following command to load the configuration:

```
pg_ctl reload
```

2.Basic parameters

Connect to the database through psql:

```
psql
```

Modify listening address

```
alter system set listen_addresses = '*';
```

> Note: The default is listening at 127.0.0.1. The service cannot be connected outside the host.

3.Guard service

Create a service file:

```
touch /usr/lib/systemd/system/ivorysql.service
```

The editing contents are as follows:

```
[Unit]
Description=IvorySQL 1.2 database server
Documentation=https://www.ivorysql.org
Requires=network.target local-fs.target
After=network.target local-fs.target

[Service]
Type=forking

User=ivorysql
Group=ivorysql

Environment=PGDATA=/ivorysql/1.2/data/

OOMScoreAdjust=-1000

ExecStart=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl start -D ${PGDATA}
ExecStop=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl stop -D ${PGDATA}
ExecReload=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl reload -D ${PGDATA}

TimeoutSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> Note: There are many ways to write a service. Be careful when using it in a production environment. Please repeat the test several times.

Stop pg_ The database service started by ctl enables the systemd service and starts:

```
systemctl enable --now ivorysql.service
```

IvorSQL database service operation command:

```
systemctl start ivorysql.service           
systemctl stop ivorysql.service            
systemctl restart ivorysql.service         
systemctl status ivorysql.service          
systemctl reload ivorysql.service           
```

==== deb pckage

Verification environment: Linux 20.04.1-Ubuntu 

1、Get deb from the official website

explain：ivorysql.deb is not currently available

2、Install deb package

```
dpkg -i ivorysql.deb
```

3、Configure environment variables

```
vi ~/.bashrc
    export PATH=/xxx/ivorysql/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/xxx/ivorysql/lib

source .bashrc
```

4、Uninstall deb package

```
dpkg -r ivorysql
```

=== Uninstall the IvorySQL database

==== Compile Uninstall

1.Backup data: The data directory is under "/ivorysql/1.2/data", so we can protect the directory. It is better to stop the database service and make a backup.

```
systemctl stop ivorysql-1.service
```

2.Compile and uninstall: switch the root session to the source directory and execute the following commands respectively:

```
make uninstall
make clean
```

3.Delete residual directories and files:

```
systemctl disable ivorysql.servicemake                  --disable Service
mv /usr/lib/systemd/system/ivorysql.service /tmp/       --the service file can be moved                                                             to/tmp or deleted
rm -fr /usr/local/pgsql                                 --remove residual installation                                                             directory
```

> Note: There are also user ivorysql and corresponding environment variables, which can be cleaned according to the situation. The rest is the data directory "/ivorysql/1.2/data". Please make sure to make a backup before processing. There are also installed dependent packages, which can be uninstalled according to the situation.


==== YUM Uninstall

1.Stop database service:

```
systemctl stop ivorysql-1.service
```

First use "yum history list" to determine the transaction ID of yum installation:

```
[root@Node02 ~]# yum history list
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror
ID     | Login user               | Date and time    | Action(s)      | Altered
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     5 | root <root>              | 2022-04-27 12:38 | Install        |   11  <
     4 | root <root>              | 2022-03-26 16:08 | Install        |   35 > 
     3 | root <root>              | 2022-03-26 16:07 | I, U           |   19   
     2 | root <root>              | 2022-03-26 16:07 | I, U           |   73   
     1 | System <unset>           | 2022-03-26 15:59 | Install        |  299   
history list
```

You can see that the transaction with ID 5 is to execute the installation. Execute the command to uninstall (replace XX with "5"):

```
yum history undo XX
```

2.unload：

```
yum remove ivorysql-server
```

However, this command is not completely uninstalled. Only 2 dependencies have been uninstalled, and 8 dependencies have not been uninstalled. You can decide whether to uninstall in this way based on whether to retain these dependencies.
