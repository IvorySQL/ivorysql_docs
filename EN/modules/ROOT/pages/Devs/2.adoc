= Psql - dual parser

== Objective

- In order to be compatible with Oracle syntax in the front-end, psql commands, and for minimal changes to the original parser of psql, a parser compatible with oracle syntax (referred to as ora_parser) is now implemented separately by using a dual parser design.

== Design schemes

- The design solution is to copy a copy of PSQL's parser and modify it to ora_parser as needed. The framework flowchart is as follows

- The detailed design flow chart is as follows:

 Note: 1. The red part is the double parser design architecture; 2. The Oracle compatible syntax has not been officially introduced;
