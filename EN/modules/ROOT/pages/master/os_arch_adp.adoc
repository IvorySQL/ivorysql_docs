| 1 | Kylin Advanced Server Operating System V11 | Kylin Advanced Server Operating System V11 is a new-generation server operating system tailor-made for enterprise-level critical businesses by Kylin Software, leveraging its years of accumulated technological R&D experience and rich application practice. With high reliability, high availability, high security, high performance, and high scalability as its core advantages, the product, on the basis of in-depth integration of AI technology, has further built a key technology system through independent innovation breakthroughs, including the high-speed network protocol MPTCP, hot patch management, intelligent fault diagnosis, scenario-based optimization, and secure container image repository. It serves as a solid, secure, and reliable supporting foundation for the informatization construction of Party and government organs, the digital transformation of key industries, and the implementation of major national projects. | image:kylin-v11.jpg[width=80%,link={imagesdir}/kylin-v11.jpg]
| 2 | openKylin 2.0 SP1 | OpenAtom openKylin is an open-source project incubated and operated by the OpenAtom Foundation. It was co-founded by basic software and hardware enterprises, non-profit organizations, associations, institutions of higher education, scientific research institutions, and individual developers. With the community vision of "providing the world with an open-source operating system deeply integrated with artificial intelligence technology", the project aims to jointly build a world-leading root community for intelligent desktop open-source operating systems on the basis of openness, voluntariness, equality, and collaboration, and promote the prosperity and development of Linux open-source technology and its software and hardware ecosystem. | image:openKylin-2.0.png[width=80%,link={imagesdir}/openKylin-2.0.png] 
| 3 | OpenAnolis OS 23 | Anolis OS 23, the Longxin Operating System, is an operating system developed by the OpenAnolis community based on the Open Source Ecosystem Development and Cooperation Initiative. It independently selects components from upstream native communities, undergoes continuous evolution, and ensures compatibility and stability. As an enterprise-level operating system built on Linux Kernel 6.6 LTS, Anolis OS 23 relies on in-depth optimization of the ANCK 6.6 kernel and fully supports domestic chips such as Haiguang, Phytium, Loongson (LoongArch), and Zhaoxin, as well as general-purpose x86_64/ARM64 architectures.
It features specialized enhancements for virtualization, security features, and performance optimization. Through hierarchical architecture design and intelligent tuning tools, it maximizes the performance of hardware-software collaboration. Meanwhile, it natively supports AI ecosystem components and provides secure AI container images, accelerating model development and inference deployment. In terms of development toolchains, it integrates GCC 12.3+/LLVM 17, Python 3.11, Rust, and more, enabling efficient multi-platform development. For the desktop ecosystem, it is compatible with GNOME and DDE desktop environments, and expands the ecosystem to meet diverse scenario needs by integrating the Linglong package manager. Anolis OS 23 supports various common applications and domestic applications, helping enterprises achieve efficient, secure, and reliable digital transformation. | image:OpenAnolis-23.jpg[width=80%,link={imagesdir}/OpenAnolis-23.jpg]
