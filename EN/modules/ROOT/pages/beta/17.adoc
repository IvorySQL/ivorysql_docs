= Dual-mode design

== Objective

- In order to meet the PG mode and the compatible Oracle mode, IVORYSQL designed two modes: PG and Oracle. And the schema can be specified at initdb time;

== Function

- Initdb -m initialization requires judgment of different modes, among which oracle mode requires the execution of SQL statements postgres_oracle.bki. The default is Oracle compatibility mode, and the process is as follows:
 
- Startup: When starting, it determines whether it is an Oracle compatibility mode based on the initialization mode;

```
Description:
database_mode: Used to indicate initialization mode;
database_mode=DB_PG，PG mode, and cannot be switched;
database_mode=DB_ORACLE， oracle compatibility mode;
```

== Test cases

```
Initialize the PG mode:
./initdb -D ../data -m pg

Initialize the Oracle compatibility mode:
./initdb -D ../data -m oracle

or
./initdb -D ../data
```
