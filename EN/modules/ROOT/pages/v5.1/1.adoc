== Version Overview

[*Release Date: Dec 18, 2025*]

IvorySQL 5.1 is built on PostgreSQL 18.1 and includes a variety of bug fixes. For a comprehensive list of updates, please visit our https://docs.ivorysql.org/[documentation site].

== Enhancements

- PostgreSQL 18.1

1. Check for CREATE privileges on the schema in CREATE STATISTICS.
2. Avoid integer overflow in allocation-size calculations within libpq.
3. Prevent “unrecognized node type” errors when a SQL/JSON function such as JSON_VALUE has a DEFAULT clause containing a COLLATE expression.
4. Avoid incorrect optimization of variable-free HAVING clauses with grouping sets.
5. Do not use parallelism in hash right semi joins.
6. Avoid possible division-by-zero when creating ordered-append plans.
7. Fix planner failure with index types that can do ordered access but not index-only scans.
