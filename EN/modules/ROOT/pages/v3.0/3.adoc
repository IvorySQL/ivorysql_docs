=== getting started guide

==== Beginners

If you are new to IvorySQL, you can click https://deploy-preview-83--ivorysql.netlify.app/zh-CN/[here] to learn about features of IvorySQL in the beginning.Also, you can download our source code through [Github](https://github.com/IvorySQL/IvorySQL).By the way, don't forget to give our IvorySQL community a star.

You can refer to the following contents to install IvorySQL quickly.

OS version of the demo:

You can install IvorySQL where you want to install it. If you want to install IvorySQL by default, execute ./configure directly.Remember to refer to the http://postgres.cn/docs/14/installation.html[manual] for other parameter settings.

To compile the IvorySQL from the source code, you have to ensure that prerequisite packages are available on your system. The following software packages are required for building IvorySQL:

* make - GNU make version 3.80 or newer
* gcc - ISO/ANSI C compiler (at least C99-compliant). Recent versions of GCC are recommended.
* libreadline - The GNU Readline library is used by default.
* zlib - zlib compression library is used by default.
* Flex - (Flex 2.5.31 or later)
* Bison - (Bison 1.875 or later)

Congratulation! You have installed IvorySQL successfully.Please enter SQL statements to experience.Have a nice day.



==== Developer guide

Developers are more concerned about how to download, install and access the database as quickly as possible. For download and installation, please refer to Part IV [Installation and Deployment]. The following describes how to access the database for clients

The client tool for connecting to the IvorySQL database service is the same as that of PostgreSQL.

===== Psql connection

Operating system user ivorysql session connection：
----
undefined
[root@localhost ~]# su - ivorysql 
Last login: Wed Feb 24 10:47:32 CST 2023 on pts/0
-bash-4.2$ psql
psql (14.2)
Type "help" for help.

ivorysql=#
