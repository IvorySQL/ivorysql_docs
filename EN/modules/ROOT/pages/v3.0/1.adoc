== Version Introduction

[**Release date: November 17, 2023**]

IvorySQL 3.0 is based on PostgreSQL 16.0 and includes various fixes from PostgreSQL 16.0, for more detailed updates and bug fixes in PostgreSQL 16.0, see the official https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16/[PostgreSQL 16.0 Release Notes].

== Updates on Version 3.0 vs 2.3

IvorySQL 3.0 signifies a major shift in its architectural design, diverging from the operational patterns established in version 2.3. It's crucial to recognize that certain features present in version 2.3 have not been incorporated into the new version. The following is an overview highlighting the primary distinctions in features between these two iterations:
