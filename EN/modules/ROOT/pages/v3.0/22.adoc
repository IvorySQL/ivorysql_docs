= Added Oracle compatibility mode ports and IP

== Objective

- In order to distinguish the Oracle port, IP and PG port IP. THERE IS NOW A NEED TO INCREASE THE PROCESSING OF ORAPORT AND ORAHOST;

== Function

- Add ivoryhost: You need to add the parameter ivoryhost when connecting, and its function is similar to host;

- New ivoryport: Compared to host, the function of port is relatively complex. It involves specifying ports in the configure phase and connection phase;

== Test method:
```
   ./configure --with-oraport=5555
   ./initdb ....
   ./pg_ctl -D ../data start
    
   ./pg_ctl -o “-p 5433 -o 1522” -D ../data
```
