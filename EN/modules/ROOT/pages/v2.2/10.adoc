= **IvorySQL Community Contribution Guide**

== **Summary**

=== Illustration

IvorySQL is maintained by a core development team, which has commit access to the main repository of IvorySQL on GitHub.Meanwhile，we are eager to get contributions from members of the wider IvorySQL community. If you want to see your changes to code or documents added to  IvorySQL and appear in future versions, you need to know the content of this section.

​IvorySQL community welcomes and appreciates all types of contributions, looking forward to your participation!

=== Principles of Conduct

For each member, contributor and leader, everyone should read our *principles of conduct* . We promise that everyone can participate in community and pay equal attention to everyone, no matter who.

We are committed to acting and interacting in a way that contributes to the establishment of an open, enthusiastic, diverse, inclusive and healthy community.

=== Description of Community Governance

Our team is a continuously open team, focusing on a part of the IvorySQL.In our team, there are reviewers, submitters and maintainers, and we have one or more repositories. The decision of the team is made by the maintainer.   The typical promotion path for IvorySQL developers is from user to reviewer, then submitter and maintainer. But getting more roles doesn't mean you have any privileges to other community members. Everyone in the IvorySQL community is equal and has the responsibility to cooperate constructively with other contributors to build a friendly community. These roles are natural rewards for your significant contributions to the development of IvorySQL, and provide you with more rights in the development workflow to improve your efficiency. At the same time，this requires you to undertake some additional duty: 

​Team honor: now you are already one of the team reviewers/submitters/maintainers, it means that you represent the project and your team members. So, please be Mr.Nice Guy to defend the reputation of the team.

​Responsibility: submitters/maintainers have the right to merge pull requests, therefore, they take additional responsibility to deal with the consequences of accepting changes to the code base or documents. When a bug occurs, they should fix it. If they can not solve it, they should roll back the project. Also, they need to help the release manager solve any problems found in the test cycle.

== **Contributor's Guide**

Before contributing, we need to know the current version of IvorySQL and the version of the document.At present, we maintain versions after version *1.3*. Our version follows the updata pace of PG. Please update to the latest version before contributing. After that, we need to read the format requirements carefully and be familiar with code format, code comment format, issue format, pull PR title format, document contribution format, and article contribution format. These can help you become a contributor of IvorySQL as soon as possible.


=== Preparation before Contribution

==== Getting started

IvorySQL is developed on GtiHub. Anyone who wishes to contribute to it must have a Github account and be familiar with Git tools and workflow. It is also recommended that you follow the developer's mailing list since some of the contributions may generate more detailed discussions there.

Once you have your GitHub account, fork this repository so that you can have your private copy to start hacking on and to use as a source of pull requests.

==== Licensing of IvorySQL contributions

If the contribution you're submitting is original work, you can assume that IvorySQL will release it as part of an overall IvorySQL release available to the downstream consumers under **the Apache License, Version 2.0**.

If the contribution you're submitting is NOT original work you have to indicate the name of the license and also make sure that it is similar in terms to the Apache License 2.0. Apache Software Foundation maintains a list of these licenses under Category A. In addition to that, you may be required to make proper attributions.

Finally, keep in mind that it is NEVER a good idea to remove licensing headers from the work that is not your original one. Even if you are using parts of the file that originally had a licensing header at the top you should err on the side of preserving it. As always, if you are not quite sure about the licensing implications of your contributions, feel free to reach out to us on the developer mailing list.


=== What Contribution can You Make

==== Code Contribution

You can upload your modified bugs, new functions and other codes to your personal warehouse, and finally submit PR requests to merge them on the official website: https://github.com/IvorySQL/IvorySQL.


==== Document Contribution(https://www.ivorysql.org/zh-CN/docs/intro)

The IvorySQL community provides Chinese and English documents. English documents are saved in ... document repository, Chinese documents are saved in i18n document repository. You can contribute to one of them or both.

==== Test IvorySQL and Report Bugs

GitHub:  https://github.com/IvorySQL/IvorySQL 

Gitee:https://gitee.com/IvorySQL/

==== Participate in the Construction of IvorySQL Website

IvorySQL official website:https://github.com/IvorySQL/Ivory-www

==== Answer Questions on the Mailing List

Mailing List website:https://lists.ivorysql.org/

==== Contribute Article

You can submit your article to the blog in the IvorySQL-WWW code warehouse, or send it to the mailbox renjiao@highgo.com.

=== How to Contribute

==== Coding Guidelines

Your chances of getting feedback and seeing your code merged into the project greatly depend on how granular your changes are. If you happen to have a bigger change in mind, we highly recommend engaging on the developer's mailing list first and sharing your proposal with us before you spend a lot of time writing code. Even when your proposal gets validated by the community, we still recommend doing the actual work as a series of small, self-contained commits. This makes the reviewer's job much easier and increases the timeliness of feedback.

When it comes to C and C++ parts of IvorySQL, we try to follow PostgreSQL Coding Conventions. In addition to that:

For C and Perl code, please run pgindent if necessary. We recommend using git diff --color when reviewing your changes so that you don't have any spurious whitespace issues in the code that you submit.

All new functionality that is contributed to IvorySQL should be covered by regression tests that are contributed alongside it. If you are uncertain about how to test or document your work, please raise the question on the ivorysql-hackers mailing list and the developer community will do its best to help you.

At the very minimum, you should always be running make installcheck-world to make sure that you're not breaking anything.

==== Changes applicable to upstream PostgreSQL

If the change you're working on touches functionality that is common between PostgreSQL and IvorySQL, you may be asked to forward-port it to PostgreSQL. This is not only so that we keep reducing the delta between the two projects, but also so that any change that is relevant to PostgreSQL can benefit from a much broader review of the upstream PostgreSQL community. In general, it is a good idea to keep both codebases handy so you can be sure whether your changes may need to be forward-ported.

==== Patch submission

Once you are ready to share your work with the IvorySQL core team and the rest of the IvorySQL community, you should push all the commits to a branch in your own repository forked from the official IvorySQL and send us a pull request.

==== Patch review

A submitted pull request with passing validation checks is assumed to be available for peer review. Peer review is the process that ensures that contributions to IvorySQL are of high quality and align well with the road map and community expectations. Every member of the IvorySQL community is encouraged to review pull requests and provide feedback. Since you don't have to be a core team member to be able to do that, we recommend following a stream of pull reviews to anybody who's interested in becoming a long-term contributor to IvorySQL.

One outcome of the peer review could be a consensus that you need to modify your pull request in certain ways. GitHub allows you to push additional commits into a branch from which a pull request was sent. Those additional commits will be then visible to all of the reviewers.

A peer review converges when it receives at least one +1 and no -1s votes from the participants. At that point, you should expect one of the core team members to pull your changes into the project.

At any time during the patch review, you may experience delays based on the availability of reviewers and core team members. Please be patient. That being said, don't get discouraged either. If you're not getting expected feedback for a few days add a comment asking for updates on the pull request itself or send an email to the mailing list.

==== Direct commits to the repository

On occasion, you will see core team members committing directly to the repository without going through the pull request workflow. This is reserved for small changes only and the rule of thumb we use is this: if the change touches any functionality that may result in a test failure, then it has to go through a pull request workflow. If, on the other hand, the change is in the non-functional part of the codebase (such as fixing a typo inside of a comment block)  core team members can decide to just commit to the repository directly.

== Website Contribution Guide

https://docs.ivorysql.org[IvorySQL Document Site] uses https://antora.org/[`Antora`] to build. Also, IvorySQL Document Site is open source. It consists of three parts, such as https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivorysql_docs[`ivorysql_docs`], https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivorysql_web[`ivorysql_web`] and https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivory-doc-builder[`ivory-doc-builder`].

Welcome everyone who is willing to participate in open source work to join us, and remember to follow our code of conduct ^_^.

=== How to Contribute

Due to the fact that IvorySQL Document Site is all hosted on Github, this allows any users to `fork` our document repository into their personal repository, make modifications to it, and then submit a PR. After being reviewed by our open source team, the modifications can be updated to our Document Site.

In order to achieve the goat of correcting document errors more conveniently, you first need to establish a personal warehouse according to the size you want to update. As follows:

* If you want to modify the existing content or add a new page, you only need to `fork` https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivorysql_docs[ivorysql_docs] to your personal repository.

* If you want to participate more deeply in the construction of IvorySQL Document Site, in addition to the `ivorysql_docs`, you also need to `fork` https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivorysql_web[ivorysql_web] and https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivory-doc-builder[ivory-doc-builder] to your personal repository.

* Next, the relevant person of the open source team will be responsible for reviewing the content you submitted. After the review is completed, the updates you submitted will appear on the corresponding page.

=== Add Page

This section will introduce how to add new page components to a website, and the modifications involved in adding new pages mainly include the following:

* Add the `.adoc` file in the `CN/modules/ROOT/pages/vX.X`.
* Modify the `CN/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc`. If the modification involves modifying or adding images, please modify the images in `images`.
* Add the `.adoc` file in the `EN/modules/ROOT/pages/vX.X`.
* Modify the `EN/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc`. If the modification involves modifying or adding images, please modify the images in `images`.

1. Firstly, you need to download the warehouse that you `fork` from `IvorySQL` to your personal computer.

    git clone https://github.com/$username$/ivorysql_docs.git

2. Then, place the `.adoc` file to be added in the correct directory, remembering that both Chinese and English files should be prepared (*Chinese and English files should have the same name*), and each file should be placed in the correct directory. At the same time, modify the corresponding `nav.adoc` file (the modification method can refer to the existing content of the file).
3. After the above modifications are completed, submit them to the personal warehouse first.

    git add .
    git commit -m "$describe your change$"
    git push

4. Afterwards, submit the PR as follows

=== Test

If you are not satisfied with simply submitting on the webpage or only modifying the webpage content, or if you want to modify the webpage UI, this section will help you.

Before reading this section, you need to confirm whether your Github personal repository has `forked` https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivorysql_docs[ivorysql_docs], https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivorysql_web[ivorysql_web] and https://github.com/IvorySQL/ivory-doc-builder[ivory-doc-builder].

==== Environmental preparation

In order to test your modifications, you need to prepare the following environment. 

* `Node.js` install
* `Antora` install

Please refer to https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/[Antora docs]。

After installation, the following display on the terminal indicates successful installation.

==== Generate web pages

* Firstly, you need to know the location of the corresponding UI for the webpage, as shown in the following figure:

The UI templates for both Chinese and English web pages are basically the same, so when making modifications, it is best to ensure that both templates are modified at the same time. After uploading the modified UI to your personal Github, you can consider generating your modified web page locally.

IvorySQL Document Site is built by `Antora`. Before running `Antora`, remember to modify the corresponding `playbook.yml` file.

After completing the above process, please run the command `antora antora-playbook.yml --stacktrace` on the terminal, and then patiently wait. After the successful operation is completed, you can view the webpage you have generated.

You can start uploading to our *ivorysql_web*, the process of submitting PR is the same as before. Thank you for your contribution to the community ^_^. We will consider whether to update the website after the review.
