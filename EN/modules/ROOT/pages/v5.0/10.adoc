= Migration guide

== Migration overview

Database migration refers to the process of transferring data from one database to another, and the databases at both ends may be PostgreSql, IvoySQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc. The migration process is a challenging, complex process that requires a thorough understanding of how databases work and their characteristics. If the application has been deployed to the production environment and is in a normal operating state, a smooth application migration is required after database migration to maintain uninterrupted business operation and no data loss.

After migration, databases and systems should meet the following requirements:

- The migrated database system should fully host the data of the original database system. Avoid data loss during migration that causes incomplete data to the new database system.

- The migrated database system should fully adapt to the functions of the original database. Avoid the inability to run or throw errors of the entire business system due to data types, syntax, and functions that are not supported after migration, and there is no alternative.

- The migrated database should be adapted to the upstream and downstream of the entire business system to ensure the stable and reliable operation of the entire business system.

- The comprehensive performance of the migrated database cannot be weaker than that of the original database, providing performance guarantee for the entire business system.

== Migration tool——Ora2Pg

Ora2Pg is a free tool for migrating Oracle databases to an IvorySQL-compatible schema. It connects to your Oracle database, automatically scans and extracts its structure or data, and then generates SQL scripts that can be loaded into an IvorySQL database. Ora2Pg can migrate from a reverse-engineered Oracle database to a large enterprise database, or simply copy some Oracle data into an IvorySQL database. It is very easy to use and does not require any Oracle database knowledge without providing the parameters required to connect to Oracle Database.

Ora2Pg consists of a Perl script (ora2pg) and a Perl module(https://github.com/darold/ora2pg/blob/master/lib/Ora2Pg.pm[Ora2Pg.pm]), the only thing that needs to be done is to modify its configuration file, ora2pg.conf, set the DSN to connect to the Oracle database, and an optional SCHEMA name. ONCE THAT'S DONE, YOU ONLY NEED TO SET THE EXPORTED TYPE: TABLE (INCLUDING CONSTRAINTS AND INDEXES), VIEW, MVIEW, TABLESPACE, SEQUENCE, INDEXES, TRIGGER, GRANT, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, PACKAGE, PARTITION, TYPE, INSERT OR COPY, FDW, QUERY, KETTLE, AND SYNONYM.

By default, Ora2Pg exports an SQL file, which can be executed through the IvorySQL client tool psql. When performing data migration, you can set the DSN of the target database in the configuration file to import data directly from Oracle into the IvorySQL database.

|===
| Object | Whether ora2pg is supported
| view | yes
| trigger           | yes，In some cases, you need to modify the script manually
| sequence          | yes
| function          | yes
| procedure         | yes，In some cases, you need to modify the script manually
| type              | yes，In some cases, you need to modify the script manually
| materialized view | yes，In some cases, you need to modify the script manually

```

=== Install Ora2pg

Download address：https://sourceforge.net/projects/ora2pg/

```
# tar -xjf  ora2pg-24.0.tar.bz2
# cd ora2pg-xx/
# perl Makefile.PL  PREFIX=<your_install_dir>
# make && make install
```

Installed in/usr/local/bin/directory by default
Check the software environment:

```
# vi check.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use ExtUtils::Installed;
my $inst= ExtUtils::Installed->new();
my @modules = $inst->modules();
foreach(@modules)
{
        my $ver = $inst->version($_) || "???";
        printf("%-12s --  %s\n", $_, $ver); 

}
exit;
# perl check.pl
DBD::Oracle  --  1.76
DBD::Pg      --  3.8.0
DBI          --  1.643
Ora2Pg       --  24.0
Perl         --  5.16.3
```

Set environment variables

```
export PERL5LIB=<your_install_dir>
#export PERL5LIB=/usr/local/bin/
```

=== Source side preparation

Update oracle statistics to improve performance

```
BEGIN
DBMS_STATS.GATHER_SCHEMA_STATS('SH');
DBMS_STATS.GATHER_SCHEMA_STATS('SCOTT');
DBMS_STATS.GATHER_SCHEMA_STATS('HR');
DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DATABASE_STATS ;
DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DICTIONARY_STATS;
END;/
```

Query the source end object pair type

```
SYS@PROD1>set pagesize 200
SYS@PROD1>select distinct OBJECT_TYPE from  dba_objects where OWNER in ('SH','SCOTT','HR');
OBJECT_TYPE
-------------------
INDEX PARTITION
TABLE PARTITION
SEQUENCE
PROCEDURE
LOB                                X
TRIGGER
DIMENSION                          X
MATERIALIZED VIEW
TABLE
INDEX
VIEW
11 rows selected.
```
=== Ora2pg export table structure

Configure ora2pg.conf

By default, Ora2Pg will find the/etc/ora2pg/ora2pg.conf configuration file. If the file exists, you only need to execute:/usr/local/bin/ora2pg

```
cat /etc/ora2pg/ora2pg.conf.dist  | grep -v ^# |grep -v ^$ >ora2pg.conf
vi ora2pg.conf
# cat ora2pg.conf
ORACLE_HOME     /opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1
ORACLE_DSN      dbi:Oracle:host=localhost;sid=ORCLCDB;port=1521
ORACLE_USER     system
ORACLE_PWD      oracle
SCHEMA          SH
EXPORT_SCHEMA  1       
SKIP  fkeys ukeys checks      
TYPE            TABLE,VIEW,GRANT,SEQUENCE,TABLESPACE,PROCEDURE,TRIGGER,FUNCTION,PACKAGE,PARTITION,TYPE,MVIEW,QUERY,DBLINK,SYNONYM,DIRECTORY,TEST,TEST_VIEW
NLS_LANG    AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8
OUTPUT     sh.sql
```

> 1. Only one type of export can be executed at the same time, so the TYPE instruction must be unique. If you have more than one, only the last one will be found in the file. But I can export multiple types at the same time.
> 2. Please note that you can link multiple exports by providing a comma-separated list of export types to the TYPE directive, but in this case, you cannot use COPY or INSERT with other export types.
> 3. Some export types cannot or should not be directly loaded into the IvorySQL database, and still require little manual editing. This is the case for GRANT, TABLESPACE, TRIGGER, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, TYPE, QUERY and PACKAGE export types, especially if you have PLSQL code or Oracle specific SQL.
> 4. For TABLESPACE, you must ensure that the file path exists on the system. For SYNONYM, you can ensure that the owner and schema of the object correspond to the new PostgreSQL database design.
> 5. It is recommended to export the table structure one type at a time to avoid other errors affecting each other.

==== **Test connection**

After setting the Oracle database DSN, you can execute ora2pg to check whether it is valid：

```
#  ora2pg -t SHOW_VERSION -c config/ora2pg.conf

Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0
```

==== Migration cost assessment

It is not easy to estimate the cost of the migration process from Oracle to PostgreSQL. In order to obtain a good evaluation of the migration cost, Ora2Pg will check all database objects, all functions and stored procedures to detect whether there are still some objects and PL/SQL code that cannot be automatically converted by Ora2Pg.
Ora2Pg has a content analysis mode, which checks the Oracle database to generate a text report about the content contained in the Oracle database and the content that cannot be exported.

```
# ora2pg -t SHOW_REPORT --estimate_cost  -c ora2pg.conf

Bitmap will be exported as btree_gin index(es) and hash index(es) will be exported as b-tree index(es) if any. Domain index are exported as b-tree but commented to be edited to mainly use FTS. Cluster, bitmap join and IOT indexes will not be exported at all. Reverse indexes are not exported too, you may use a trigram-based index (see pg_trgm) or a reverse() function based index and search. Use 'varchar_pattern_ops', 'text_pattern_ops' or 'bpchar_pattern_ops' operators in your indexes to improve search with the LIKE operator respectively into varchar, text or char columns.      11 bitmap index(es). 1 domain index(es). 2 b-tree index(es).

MATERIALIZED VIEW       2       0       6       All materialized view will be exported as snapshot materialized views, they are only updated when fully refreshed.

SYNONYM 0       0       0       SYNONYMs will be exported as views. SYNONYMs do not exists with PostgreSQL but a common workaround is to use views or set the PostgreSQL search_path in your session to access object outside the current schema.

TABLE   11      0       1.1     1 external table(s) will be exported as standard table.

=== Import table structure

Because of the materialized view, in TABLE_ The sh.sql contains the index of the materialized view, which will fail to create. You need to first create a table, then create a materialized view, and finally create an index.
Cancel the materialized view index and create it separately later:

```
CREATE INDEX fw_psc_s_mv_chan_bix ON fweek_pscat_sales_mv (channel_id);

CREATE INDEX fw_psc_s_mv_promo_bix ON fweek_pscat_sales_mv (promo_id);

CREATE INDEX fw_psc_s_mv_subcat_bix ON fweek_pscat_sales_mv (prod_subcategory);

CREATE INDEX fw_psc_s_mv_wd_bix ON fweek_pscat_sales_mv (week_ending_day);

CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION en (COPY = pg_catalog.english);
ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION en ALTER MAPPING FOR hword, hword_part, word WITH unaccent, english_stem;
```

```

When using, there are two options -- project_ Base and -- init_ Project indicates to ora2pg that he must create a project template, which contains the work tree, configuration files and scripts for exporting all objects from the Oracle database. Generate a generic configuration file. 1. Create script export_ Schema.sh to automatically perform all exports. 2. Create script import_ All.sh to automatically perform all imports. example：

```
mkdir -p  /ora2pg/migration

# ora2pg --project_base /ora2pg/migration/ --init_project test_project
Creating project test_project.
