== Version Overview

[*Release Date: Nov 25, 2025*]

IvorySQL 5.0, based on PostgreSQL 18.0, introduces significant Oracle compatibility improvements, PL/iSQL enhancements, and new globalization capabilities while refreshing packaging, automation, and tooling. For a comprehensive list of updates, please visit our https://docs.ivorysql.org/[documentation site].

== Enhancements

- PostgreSQL 18.0

1. An asynchronous I/O (AIO) subsystem that can improve performance of sequential scans, bitmap heap scans, vacuums, and other operations.
2. pg_upgrade now retains optimizer statistics.
3. Support for "skip scan" lookups that allow using multicolumn B-tree indexes in more cases.
4. uuidv7() function for generating timestamp-ordered UUIDs.
5. Virtual generated columns that compute their values during read operations. This is now the default for generated columns.
6. OAuth authentication support.
7. OLD and NEW support for RETURNING clauses in INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE commands.
8. Temporal constraints, or constraints over ranges, for PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, and FOREIGN KEY constraints.
